# Part 9
## Putting things in a list

Now, our code from Part 8 is giving us errors. This is due to us missing an XML file we referenced in our adapter's `newView` method. We need to create a layout for our note list items.

Head into your res -> layouts folder and create a new layout resource file called `note_list_item`. We can leave the root element as the default (we'll change this soon).
