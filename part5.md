## Running our project!

Now is one of the most important steps, actually running our project. We have two options, the first is running it on a physical device, the second is running it on an emulator.

Running the project on a device is the most ideal since it's fastest and has the advantage of physical hardware.

To run our app we can look up to the toolbar and see the green arrow, clicking on it will give us a dialog looking like so.

If you do not have a device plugged in you won't see your device. To ensure you see it make sure that you have "USB Debugging" turned on

### Running on an Emulator (Optional)
If you don't have an Android device you can use an emulator. *Note: This may not work great depending on how powerful your laptop is*.

First, let's create an Android emulator. 

1. Click on Create New Virtual Device
2. Determine which device you'd like to emulate, I chose a Pixel 2.

3. Next pick the Android version (I suggest using the latest released version, in this case Android Oreo). You may need to download it first, do that and then continue.

4. Finally, give the Android Vertual Device a name and click Finish.

## The result
The result should look something like this.
