# Refreshing Our List

There's a few things you should know when refreshing the list. To actually preform the refresh, you can simply use the `loadNotesFromDatabase();` method again.

However, making a good UI for this is up to you. Here are some links to get you started.

- [SwipeToRefresh documentation from Android](https://developer.android.com/training/swipe/add-swipe-interface.html)
- The `onResume()` method is called when a the `Activity` loses focus, and then regains focus (i.e you return from a different view). [onResume](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onResume()).

You can implement any UI you'd like for refreshing, as long as you can make an argument for it's UI/UX.
