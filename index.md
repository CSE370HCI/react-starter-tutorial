# Part 1
## Creating a new Android Project

First we'll need to create a new project. We'll start by heading to `File -> New -> New Project`

This will pop open a new dialog to help you start your project. In the future, you can use a template to make more complex/advanced views. However, we'll be doing it simple.

First, pick out a name and "Company Domain" this is simply a package name. You can name your project whatever you'd like, and the company domain should generally be in a something.com format. This will generate your package name (com.something.yourproject).

Note: We're unchecking C++ and Kotlin support since we'll be writing this in Java.


We can leave the defaults for the "Target Android Version" since API level 15 is the recommended amount.

After, we'll pick "Empty Activity". This will create a basic activity with nothing in it.

Finally, we can leave the default name for our activity. Then click finish and Android Studio will create our project.
