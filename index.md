# Part 1
## Creating a new Android Project

First we'll need to create a new project. We'll start by heading to `File -> New -> New Project`

This will pop open a new dialog to help you start your project. In the future, you can use a template to make more complex/advanced views. However, we'll be creating a simple application here.

First, we'll be picking the "Empty Activity" view for our project. This will create a basic activity with nothing in it.

Next, pick out a name and a "Package Name". The package name is simply a unique identifier for the app store and your device. You can name your project whatever you'd like

Make sure Java is selected (unless your team decides to use Kotlin) and continue. (You can leave the default Minimum API level)

Finally, click finish and Android Studio will create our project.
