# Part 1
## Getting Started

This tutorial has been adapted from [w3schools.com’s React Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/default.asp) to suit UB CSE’s 370 course (Human Computer Interaction).

You can access a full demo application for the course by visiting the [Conclusion](conclusion.html) of this tutorial.

### Technical Setup
We will be using Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) to setup and run our project. You can find [installation instructions here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once we have NPM installed, we can use the `create-react-app` tool to get started! Open up a terminal and run the following command:

```
npx create-react-app my-social-media-site
```

You can replace `my-social-media-site` with whatever you would like to call your project. By running this command, a directory with a starter React application will be created.


### Starting Our App
Now that we've created a new React app, we can start it using `npm`!

First, navigate to the new React application's directory by running the following command:

```
cd my-social-media-site
```

Once inside the directory, we can start our React app by running

```
npm start
```

This will open up a new browser window with our webpage (hosted at `localhost:3000` by default). Any time we make changes to our code while `npm start` is running, the webpage should update!
