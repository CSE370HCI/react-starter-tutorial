# Part 2
## What are we looking at?

Once you have your project created, we'll see a few different things. The Android Studio editor has open two files `MainActivity.java and `activity_main.xml`. 
Similar to JavaFX, Android uses XML for layouts. It also has a built in editor that we'll be using. MainActivity.java is connected with the XML file (which we will look at more soon).

> Note: You can change the view of your project with the dropdown. Currently it's on "Android" although I prefer the "Project" view. It's personal preference

## Files
Now let's look at our files. On the left you'll see a `java` directory and a `res` directory. In the `java` directory we'll put all of the logic for our program. Each activity's code will be here.
In the `res` directory we'll contain all resources. This includes layouts, images, strings, and colors.

> drawable -> All XML images  
> layout -> All of the layouts for our activities  
> mipmap -> Images  
> values -> Strings, colors, and styles (oh my)
